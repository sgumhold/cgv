/*! \mainpage glsu The OpenGL Stereo Utility Library

The glsu library allows easy development of stereoscopic OpenGL applications.
It supports anaglyph, side by side, horizontal split and quad buffer stereo and provides functions
to set up the projection matrices for the frustums of left and right eye that are necessary for
stereoscopic rendering.

This is release 1.0 of the glsu library and is copyright (C) by Stefan Gumhold.

\section License glsu License May 26, 2011
The glsu library and included programs are provided under the terms
of a derivative of the BSD 3-Clause License as stated in the accompanying 
file \c license.txt.

\section Installation Installation of the glsu Library
The glsu library itself consists of the following two files:
- \c include/GL/glsu.h
- \c src/glsu.cxx

Two test programs are provided that use glut / freeglut or fltk
to create an OpenGL window. The following files are included
- \c test/test_glsu.h ... header of class that encapsulates common functionality
- \c test/test_glsu.cxx ... source code of class that encapsulates common functionality
- \c test/test_glsu_glut.cxx ... source code of test application that uses glut
- \c test/test_glsu_fltk.cxx ... source code of test application that uses fltk

\subsection Deps Dependencies
The \c glsu library depends only on \c OpenGL.

The accompanying test examples depend on
- \c glu and \c glut, (under Windows ensure that environment variable \c GLUT_ROOT_PATH is set) or
- \c glu and \c fltk2 (under Windows ensure that environment variable \c FLTK2_DIR is set)

\subsection Makefiles Accompanying Makefiles
CMake project files are provided and have been tested under windows for visual studio 2008. The project
contains an installation procedure that installs the library header, the lib files and the
dlls to an installation directory to be defined in CMake in the advanced settings in the
\c CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX variable after the first configuration process. After compilation
of the library it is important to execute the \c INSTALL project in order to place the
generated dlls in the bin directory of the installation path. This should be contained
in the \c PATH variable in order for the system to be able to find it when starting the
program. For the glut-based test the system variable \c GLUT_ROOT_PATH should be set
to the glut or freeglut directory and the glut-libs and dlls should be found in the relative
directories \c Release and \c Debug.

\section Basics Basics on Stereoscopic Rendering
Full stereoscopic vision can only be stimulated by rendering a 3D 
scene twice - once from the position of the left eye and once from 
the position of the right eye and presenting each image only to the
corresponding eye. 

\subsection Separation Separation of Images
Several techniques allow to display two different
images to the different eyes:
- passive stereo ... the light from two projectors are polarized before
  projecting onto a common screen, that has to be built with a special 
  material that preserves polarization. Orthogonal polarization directions 
  are used and glasses with polarization filters allow to view the differnt
  images with the different eyes.
- active stereo ... images for left and right images are switched very fast
  over time on a fast display. Shutter glasses that allow to darken each eye
  individually very rapidly are used to select display to each eye only the
  corresponding images.
- anaglyph ... different color channels are used to transport left and right
  image. Often the red channel is used for the left eye and the blue and 
  optionally green channel for the right eye.

\subsection Modes Stereo Modes
GPUs support these stereoscopic display modes in the following manners
- color masks ... during rendering color masks allow to select the color
  channels into which the current rendering process is writing. In this way
  anaglyph stereo can be supported with standard double buffering.
- split viewports ... the desktop can be extended over two display each 
  supplying one projector with the corresponding image. This can be done 
  for active stereo. Again standard double buffering can be used. The two
  rendering processes simply need to use only one half of the viewport.
- quad buffering ... nvidia FX Quadro cards have native support for stereo. Here
  the double buffering is extended to quad buffering with one color buffer
  for each eye. Two displays can then be attached to the GPU in clone mode
  showing the same gui but views for the different eyes inside OpenGL windows.

In the glsu library the supported different display modes are defined
in the enum type StereoMode. For the SM_ANAGLYPH mode there are different
possibilities to map the left and eight eye to different color channels. These
combinations are defined in the enum type AnaglyphConfiguration.

\subsection Frustums Stereo View Frustums
Besides the configuration of the rendering process for the different stereo
modes one has to define different view frustums for the left and right eye
through corresponding projection matrices. The basic idea is to imagine the
display screen to be part of the scene. Also imagine a center eye in the middle
of the left and right eyes. One distinguishes an observer located at a fixed position
centered in front of a screen and a free observer. 

\subsubsection Fixed Fixed Observer
In case of the fixed observer location, let the screen center be located at a distance 
\c zZeroParallax away from the center eye along the view direction. The monoscopic frustum is
defined by six planes: the near and far clipping planes, and four planes spanned by 
the center eye and the four edges of the screen.

\image html stereo3d.png "3D illustration of stereo frustums"

The stereoscopic frustums are defined similarly by the same near and far clipping
planes and four planes spanned by the corresponding eye and the same four edges of
the screen. It is important to keep the view direction, which defines the optical center
in the image, parallel to the view direction of the center eye. Otherwise the pixels on
the screen would not be of square shape anymore - their shape would rather vary over the
screen. 

In monoscopy mode one only needs one symmetric frustum that is defined for example
with the \c gluPerspective(fovy,aspect,zNear,zFar) function.
This frustum can be updated by appending a shear along the x axis
depending on the z-coordinate followed by a translation along the x-axis 
(by plusminus the half of the eye separation). The effect of shearing and 
translation cancel at the parallax zero distance where the screen is located
in the scene.

\image html stereo_top.png "top view illustrating important quantities"

To following quantities are used to specify the stereo frustums
- \c GLdouble \c fovy, \c aspect, \c zNear and \c zFar ... as in gluPerspective, i.e. the view
                    angle along the y-direction, the aspect ratio of the
					screen (width/height) and the distances along the
					viewing directions to the near and far clipping planes.
- \c GlsuEye \c eye ... left (-1), center (0) or right (1) eye for which to generate the frustum
- \c GLdouble \c eyeSeparation ... distance between left and right eye measured relative to the
                             width of the screen positioned at parallax zero depth, i.e. 
					         a separation of 1 corresponds to the complete width of the screen.
- \c GLdouble \c screenWidth  ... the width of the screen in eye coordinates
- \c GLdouble \c screenHeight ... the height of the screen in eye coordinates
- \c GLdouble \c zZeroParallax ... distance along view direction (same scaling as zNear and zFar) at
                             which to place the parallax zero plane of the screen

\subsubsection Free Free Observer
In case of a free observer it is still important that the view direction  is orthogonal to the screen
for all frustums (left, center, right). This implies that the optical axis is along eye and orthogonal
projection of the eye onto the screen. The following figure shows an example of a free observer and
the important quantities that define the frustums:

\image html freeObserver.png "important quantities in free observer mode with frustums clipped by synchronized near and far clipping planes"

To following quantities are used to specify the stereo frustums in case of the free observer
- \c GlsuEye \c eye ... left (-1), center (0) or right (1) eye for which to generate the frustum
- \c GLdouble \c eyeSeparation ... distance between left and right eye measured relative to the
                             width of the screen, i.e. a separation of 1 corresponds to the complete width of the screen.
- \c GLdouble \c screenWidth  ... the width of the screen in eye coordinates
- \c GLdouble \c screenHeight ... the height of the screen in eye coordinates
- \c GLdouble \c observerLocation[3] ... 3d location of the center eye defined in the screen coordinate system, where the origin is in the 
                                         screen center, x- and y-directions are synchronized with the right and up direction of the screen and the
										 z-direction points towards the observer, such that the z-coordinate is typically positive. Compared to the
										 fixed observer case this z-coordinate corresponds to the parallax zero distance. The screen coordinate 
										 system is not normalized with respect to the \c screenWidth and \c screenHeight, i.e. to put the observer
										 in the upper right corner, use the coordinates 0.5\c screenWidth, 0.5\c screenHeight.
- \c GLdouble \c eyeSeparationDirection[3] ... 3d vector pointing from the left to the right eye. This direction is again given in the screen 
                                         coordinate system. The length of this vector is ignored. 
- \c GLdouble \c zNear and \c zFar ... distances along the viewing directions to the near and far clipping planes.
                                       Typically one wants to synchronize the clipping planes in space even if one
									   of the eyes is closer to the screen. As illustrated in the previous figure,
									   the eye closer to the screen defines the clipping planes for all frustums in
									   case of synchronized clipping planes.

\section Usage Usage of the glsu Library
\subsection Config Configuring the Rendering Process
In the following section the definition of the stereo frustums is explained. Here we first suppose
that there is a function \c draw_from_eye(GlsuEye) that sets the frustum of the passed eye and renders
the scene. With this function the stereo rendering process can be implemented with the glsu library
with the help of the \c glsuConfigureStereo function as done in the \c draw method of the \c test_glsu 
class:

\dontinclude test_glsu.cxx
\skip ::draw()
\skip else {
\until }

The third call to \c glsuConfigureStereo with the center eye is important to reconstruct the global settings.

For convenience the functions \c glsuStereoRenderProcess, \c glsuStereoRenderProcessScreen and \c glsuStereoRenderProcessFreeObserver
are provided. These take all stereo parameters as input plus a callback function and a user data of type \c void*, which implements the
monoscopic rendering of the scene excluding the definition of the projection matrix. The \c test_glsu class implements
this callback in the static member function \c draw_callback

\dontinclude test_glsu.cxx
\skip draw_callback
\until }

And uses the convenience function in the \c draw method:

\dontinclude test_glsu.cxx
\skip ::draw()
\skip else
\until }

\subsection Frustum Defining the Stereo Frustums
The glsu library uses three subsets of parameters to define the frustums:
- \c eye, \c eyeSeparation, \c fovy, \c aspect, \c zZeroParallax, \c zNear, \c zFar ... here the screen
  dimensions are computed from the viewing angle in y-direction \c fovy, the aspect ration \c aspect and
  the distance \c zZeroParallax from the viewer.
- \c eye, \c eyeSeparation, \c screenWidth, \c screenHeight, \c zZeroParallax, \c zNear, \c zFar ... here
  the screen dimensions are specified in world coordinates.
- \c eye, \c eyeSeparation, \c screenWidth, \c screenHeight, \c observerLocation, \c eyeSeparationDirection, \c zNear, \c zFar, \c synchClippingPlanes ... 
  these parameters are used for the free observer. If \c synchClippingPlanes is not \c 0, the near and far clipping planes are synchronized for the
  frustums of the different eyes.

Names of functions that use the second and third subset are appended with the postfix \c Screen and \c FreeObserver respectively.

For correct illumination relative to two different eye locations, one would have
to perform the shearing on the projection matrix stack and the translation on the
model view matrix stack as done in the \c draw_from_eye_physical method of the
\c test_glsu class:

\dontinclude test_glsu.cxx
\skip draw_from_eye_physical
\until }

In case of a fixed observer the projection stack part can be also based on the specification of a monoscopic frustum followed
by a shear with the function \c glsuStereoShear:
\code
	glMatrixMode(GL_PROJECTION_MATRIX);
	glLoadIdentity();
	gluPerspective(fovy, aspect, zNear, zFar);
	glsuStereoShear(eye, eyeSeparation, fovy, aspect, zZeroParallax);
\endcode

This correct approach places highlights on different locations on illuminated 
surfaces, what hinders stereoscopic fushion by the human observer. This is illustrated
in the following two comparisons on the right side with the greenish background

\image html comparison_anaglyph.png "Anaglyph view of comparison between convenient illumination on the left with blue background and physically correct illumination on the right with green background"
	
\image html comparison_tbb.png "Vertical split view of comparison between convenient illumination on the left with blue background and physically correct illumination on the right with green background"

To avoid this, one can perform both shearing and translation on the projection stack, 
such that illumination is done for both eyes from the center eye location. This is implemented
in the \c draw_from_eye_convenient method of \c test_glsu: 

\dontinclude test_glsu.cxx
\skip draw_from_eye_convenient
\until }

The projection stack part can be extended to:
\code
	glMatrixMode(GL_PROJECTION_MATRIX);
	glLoadIdentity();
	gluStereoFrustum(eye, eyeSeparation, fovy, aspect, zZeroParallax,zNear,zFar);
	gluStereoTranslate(eye, eyeSeparation, fovy, aspect, zZeroParallax);
\endcode

or in case of fixed observer be based on a monoscopic frustum:
\code
	glMatrixMode(GL_PROJECTION_MATRIX);
	glLoadIdentity();
	gluPerspective(fovy,aspect,zNear,zFar);
	gluStereoShear(eye, eyeSeparation, fovy, aspect, zZeroParallax);
	gluStereoTranslate(eye, eyeSeparation, fovy, aspect, zZeroParallax);
\endcode
