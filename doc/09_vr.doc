\section VRIntro Introduction to VR Support in CGV Framework

The VR support distributed over several libraries and plugins. 
The following list gives a brief overview:

- cgv/libs/vr \ref VR

  basic interface to implement vr apps that is independent of cgv framework and specific
  vr api. It builds on the concept of a driver that provides instances of vr kits. There
  can be several drivers in use at the same time. A simple registry is used to manage 
  drivers and vr kits. The vr_kit class provides access to the display and the controllers
  with a simple state polling api.

- cgv/plugins/openvr_driver

  implements the vr interface for the openvr api. The api header, libs and windows dlls are
  included. The dlls are provided in the paths cgv/bin/win32 and cgv/bin/win64. The platform
  specific path is added when executing the script cgv/define_system_variables.bat.
  The only thing that needs to be done is to add the openvr_driver plugin as dependent project
  in the .pj-file.

- cgv/plugins/vr_emulator
  
  implements the vr interface for emulated vr kits and supports multiple kits at the same time.
  When added to the .pj-file, the vr_emulator defines a new tabgroup in the user interface and
  handles some key events:
  
  - Ctrl-Alt-N ... creates a new vr_kit
  
  Each vr_kit is controlled by a very simple model of the human body that can move and turn,
  bend the hip forward/backward, turn the head left or right (gear) and move each hand a local
  3D coordinate system with origin in the corresponding shoulder and oriented as the hip 
  coordinate system.

  To control the body model the vr_emulator allows to use the keys <0>, <1>, <2>, and <3> as 
  modifier keys to control up to 4 vr_kits with the keyboard. The arrow keys allow to move and
  rotate. <PgUp> and <PgDn> correspond to the hip bending and <Home> and <End> to gearing.
  
  The controller keys of each kit are emulated with the following keys pressed with the vr_kit
  modifier key (<0>,...,<3>) hold down:

  - Q ... left menu
  - A ... left button 0
  - W ... left button 1
  - D ... left button 2
  - X ... left button 3
  - C ... left touch
  - S ... left press
  - O ... right menu
  - L ... right button 0
  - I ... right button 1
  - J ... right button 2
  - M ... right button 3
  - K ... right touch
  - N ... right press
  
  To make sure that all keys are dispatched by the vr_emulator, select it for keyboard focus
  with the tab key or by selecting its tab group.

- cgv/plugins/cg_vr

  This plugin connects the vr library to the cgv/gui library by translating changes in the
  vr kit states into events. The central class for this is cgv::gui::vr_server. Please see
  its documentation.
  
- cgv/plugins/crg_vr_view

  This plugin extends the stereo_view_interactor class of the crg_stereo_view plugin with
  vr support to the vr_view_interactor class. It connects to the on_device_change 
  signal of the cgv::gui::vr_server singelton and keeps track of device changes in order 
  to initialize and destruct their framebuffers in the opengl context of the vr_view_interactor.
  
  It keeps a current vr_kit which can be selected with Ctrl-Alt-<0..3> or through the 
  user interface. It can render the VR kits in a very simplistic way by some spheres 
  representing the eyes and hands. Furthermore, it can render the action zone boundaries
  as a dashed fence. It can also debug all emitted vr events in the text console window.
  The vr_view_interactor manages its own view which can be controlled with the mouse as in the
  case of the stereo_view_interactor. Further rendering passes are issued to render from the
  views of the hmds of the present vr kits. The current vr kit states are queried with
  pose_query=2 for the currently selected vr kit and with pose_query=1 for the others.
  The rendered vr views are submitted to the hmds and can optionally blit in the current 
  framebuffer. The queried states are transfered to the cgv::gui::vr_server singleton with the
  check_new_state() function such that you should use the second or third option descripted in
  the detailed documentation of the cgv::gui::vr_server.
